## Welcome to my playground! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zach, a Ph.D. in Mathematics that uses his experience and skills to dive deeper into data science and interactive ways to teach *seemingly scary* math subjects! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on translating my Ph.D. work in MATLAB to Python to highlight my contributions in an open source setting!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build visualization applets with Streamlit to visualize concepts in Linear Algebra like matrix-vector multiplication and determinants!
