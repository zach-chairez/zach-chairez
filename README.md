## Welcome to my playground! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zach, a Ph.D. in Mathematics that uses his experience and skills to dive deeper into data science and interactive ways to teach *seemingly scary* math subjects! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on translating my Ph.D. work in MATLAB to Python to highlight my contributions in an open source setting!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build visualization applets with Streamlit to visualize concepts in Linear Algebra like matrix-vector multiplication and determinants!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: zach.chairez@gmail.com
- âš¡ My pinned repos:
    - ML:  My personal data science projects which include predictive modeling and computer vision problems.
    - PhD-Work:  MATLAB and Python code for feature selection models I developed during my Ph.D.
    - linear-algebra:  Visualization applets for linear algebra concepts.
    - Project-Euler:  This is a fun one where I attack challenging mathematical problems in Python from [projecteuler.com](https://projecteuler.net/).
